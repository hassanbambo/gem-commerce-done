My Approach

First, I gathered all the assests that I need from the Figma file (such as Images Icons)
Then, I took some time to observe the design to find common patterns and elements with recurring style rules (so that they can be grouped together for efficient styling).

What I did was break down the page into three section (using HTML to semantically structure the contents as much as possible), 
after which I applied some CSS for layout and styling (I used flexboxes a lot because I believe it to be the modern standard as compared to the float, positioning, and some older layout techniques).

Finally, I'm hosting it using GitHub Pages...
